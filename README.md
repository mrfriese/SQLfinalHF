# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Understand and complete first SQL project.
## Process
Create tables and upload CSV files.
Analyze data to understand the information
Clean data for use
Use queries to obtain valuable insights

## Results
From the data I found there is a lot of information on where the company performs its business, but much more information is missing and is impacting business success.

## Challenges 

In doing this project I found many ways to make errors, beginning with how to create a table and import files. I also identified this project is a very real example of the complications that I will encounter in the real world. By working with the data I have begun to learn where errors can occur and how to identify and solve them.

## Future Goals
I would arrange data into new tables with relevant information for easy viewing and comprehension. I would also like to add new tables based on calculations from others that would provide useful and relevant insight.
